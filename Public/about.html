                <h2>Experience</h2>
                    <p>For the last 14 years I have been a stay at home parent for my 3<br/>
                    children and have now decided to embark on a new chapter, gaining<br/>
                    skills that I find challenging and engaging.</p>
                    <p>While I am new to the world of coding and web development,<br/>
                    I am currently looking for opportunities to help others while also<br/>
                    testing and strengthening my current capabilities.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                    <p>I enjoy cooking from cultures all around the world and<br/>
                    experimenting in the kitchen,  using my family as willing<br/>
                    guinea pigs.</p>

                    <p>When I find the time I also love art in the form of sketching<br/>
                    from still life, and more recently with print making.</p>

                    <p>Sewing and wood-making are two other hobbies that I've<br/>
                    dipped my toes in, and am finding great satisfaction in learning.</p>

                    <p>Coding is my newest passion, I have found a commonality<br/>
                    between all these interests; at the completion of anyone of them<br/>
                    there exists something that hadn't before. This creation of new<br/>
                    useful food, art, clothes, furniture, and tools is something I find<br/>
                    deeply satisfying and fulfilling.</p>
